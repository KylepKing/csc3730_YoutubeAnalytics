# SUBJECT TO CHANGE
# csc3730_YoutubeAnalytics
This is a repository for a Machine Learning Project in which we scrape data from the Youtube API and run analysis on the data for the different video categories of Youtube. 


# Setup
1.Pull from this repo
2.Create in the root a .env file and add the API_KEY=google key variable. 
3. pip install all packages used (pandas, dotenv, seaborn, google-api-python-client) ex: pip install google-api-python-client
4. save and run code.

# Notes
Current version is just for data testing and figuring out the Youtube API. Will be adapted later for the project
